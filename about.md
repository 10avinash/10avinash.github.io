Hi, I am a Master of Arts in Economics student at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/economics/). I graduated with a Bachelor's degree (Bachelor of Technology) in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology](https://www.iist.ac.in/).  
  
So far, I have worked on projects which have two things in common: they all involve a good level of programming challenges, and eventually can be linked to social science theory and applications. I have been fortunate enough to be able to get to work on such [interesting projects](https://10avinash.github.io/projects/).

I have used, for the logo of this website, an image of one of my favourite content creators. He is the incredible [Grant Sanderson](https://www.3blue1brown.com/about), or you might know him from his youtube channel: [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw). His channel explains advanced mathematical concepts intuitively and helps me internalise these ideas.
