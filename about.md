Hi, I am a Research Associate at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City](https://www.kansascityfed.org/). On the research side I support Dr. Jordan Rappaport(https://www.kansascityfed.org/people/jordanrappaport) and Dr. Amaze Lusompa(https://sites.google.com/uci.edu/amazelusompa).

I graduated in the spring of 2020 with a Master of Arts in Economics student at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/economics/) . I have a bachelor's degree (Bachelor of Technology) in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology](https://www.iist.ac.in/).  
  
So far, I have worked on projects which have two things in common: they all involve a good level of programming challenges, and eventually can be linked to social science theory and applications. I have been fortunate enough to be able to get to work on such [interesting projects](https://10avinash.github.io/projects/).

I have used, for the logo of this website, an image of one of my favourite content creators, the incredible [Grant Sanderson](https://www.3blue1brown.com/about). You might know him from his YouTube channel: [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw). His channel explains advanced mathematical concepts intuitively and helps me internalise these ideas.

### What I am Reading   
I am reading Doris Kearns Goodwin's fabulous book Team of Rivals. It is bulky but it is very interesting!
On my reading list are: 1) Keeping at It by Paul Volcker  
                        2) Reporting by David Remnick (I am a big big fan of David Remnick and I think he is the smartest commentator there is in America)  
                        3) Firefighting by Ben Bernanke  
                        4) House of Debt by Atif Milan and Amir Sufi
 other stuff:                   
I came across [this](http://www.robertburns.org/works/) website which has the collections of the works of the great Scottish poet Robert Burns. I am reading his works inspired by [this](http://www.robertburns.org/works/416.shtml) poem.  
Just read "The Importance of Being Earnest" by Oscar Wilde. It is hilarious. [Link](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/844/844-h/844-h.htm)
