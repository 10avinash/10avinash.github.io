Hi, I am a Master of Arts student in Economics at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/economics/). I graduated with a Bachelor's degree (Bachelor of Technology) in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology](https://www.iist.ac.in/).  
So far, I have worked on projects which have two things in common: they all involve a good level of programming challenges, and eventually can be linked to social science theory and applications. I have been fortunate enough to be able to get to work on such interesting projects.
