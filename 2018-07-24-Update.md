## Comments!
 I have added the comments option to blogs. The comments aren't moderated. You need to login with disqus, which is pretty easy if you have a google/facebook account.
 
 Note That
 1) The comments aren't moderated to provide for a liberal discussion of topics. There is no need to agree with me on any of the issues.
 2) There shouldn't be any form of discrimantory which demean a religion or a region be posted. Such posts would lead to a comments section where everythin will be moderated by a Big Brother.
