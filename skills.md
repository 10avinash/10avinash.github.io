Some of my research interests:  
* Reinforcement Learning applications to economics and finance.  
* Estimation of causal parameters using Bayesian modeling.    
* Time series forecasting using machine learning and econometrics.  
* Social networks for business and policy applications [[Link to my paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8960302)].    

What I like in a job: Any role which is quantitative and helps me learn new stuff. I aspire to be surrounded by people 
who are smarter and more knowledgable than me.
