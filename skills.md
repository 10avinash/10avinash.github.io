The skills I bring to the table:  
1) Solid understanding of applied mathematics, probability, and statistics concepts.  
2) Ability to program in Python, MATLAB, R, SQL, and Stata.
3) Interest in learning new technical concepts and tools.  

I have relevant coursework in Mathematical Optimisation, Probability and Statistics, Bayesian Statistics, Econometrics, Data Management and Visualisation, and Asset Pricing Theory. I will be taking a graduate level class at University of Missouri at Kansas City
  

I am currrently (outside of work projects) working on a paper on simulating Soccer matches using network theory metrics. The goal is to develop a theoretical framework which will be helpful in doing statistical simulation of matchers and compare players empirically outside of regular metrics. If you are soccer nerd (especially a soccer nerd with data) get in touch!

I also have a draft in work on measuring the impact of inequality on asset pricing. Again, this is looking to develop a theoretical framework. I started working on this project during my masters program under the guidance of Dr. Daniel Neuhann in his Asset Pricing Class. Covid 19 sort of disrupted some work flow for it but I am really eager to continue working on it after sorting out some mathematical and programming bottlenecks.
