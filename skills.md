The skills I bring to the table:    
1) Solid understanding of applied mathematics, probability, and statistics concepts.    
2) Ability to program in Python, MATLAB, R, SQL, and Stata.  
3) Interest in learning new technical concepts and tools.  

I have relevant coursework in Mathematical Optimisation, Probability and Statistics, Bayesian Statistics, Econometrics, Data Management and Visualisation, and Asset Pricing Theory. Furthermore, I will be taking a graduate level class this Fall semester on Numerical Analysis (mainly to learn numerical differntial equations) at University of Missouri at Kansas City.
