## Brown is the new white
Demographers have proved that the U.S. will not be a non hispanic white majority country in the coming decades. While this to some might feel natural, to many people this causes immense anxiety. In [this](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/30/17505406/trump-obama-race-politics-immigration) lengthy, well researched, and great piece Erza Klein argues that racial anxiety, especially a loss of sense of majority, is the main cause for radical views among white Americans. This challenged conventional wisdom, certainly my beliefs, because it doesn't associate the rise of Trump primarily with economic discontent rather social. I think, in this case the evidence is now more clear, that racial anxiety has triggered economic discontent too. If economic discontent (finanical crash, median income stagnation etc) was the main issue wouldn't America elect a man who can articulate his views on economic policy better than social policy? Economists have a  saying "correlation doesn't equal causation" it essentially means that just because two things coincide doesn't mean one causes the other. Perhaps, there needs to be more research because this is a very nuanced issue, it is not simply about being racist, or sexist, or homophobic. It's much more.
