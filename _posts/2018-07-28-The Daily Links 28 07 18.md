## Syria: The Carnage Doesn't End, atleast for the Children

UN has released a set of new statistics. The year 2017 was the most deadly year for children in Syria and this year will be even worse. More children were killed in the first quarter of 2018 than in the last quarter of 2017. This seems to have occured due to increased attack at school and hospitals. There is also a 25% increase in child soldiers. The news has died down because of increased control by the Syrian Government forces.
