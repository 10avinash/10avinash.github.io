## Data won Wimbledon

Angelique Kerber won the  women's singles at Wimbledon after beating tennis superstar Serena Williams. She dropped out of the top 20 Rankings last year after a stellar 2016 when she won two grand slams. But all that clearly changed when she took Data assisted coaching. Her coach, Wim Fissette is data driven. He primarily seems to view his object, the article on [espn](http://www.espn.in/tennis/story/_/id/24182180/tennis-how-data-driven-coaching-helped-angelique-kerber-latest-crown) suggests, as utilising the best statistics to improve the player. He doesn't give the player all the statistics he has, only the important ones. He also seems to believe that each player needs to be dealth with differently when it comes to statistics. There can be a cautious extropolation to suggest that, Data will make sports great and statistics will become,if not already, a common staple.
