## The Most Connected Government - Facebook

In [this](https://www.vox.com/explainers/2018/7/20/17590694/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-holocaust-denial-recode) piece [erza klien](https://www.vox.com/authors/ezra-klein) explains the recent Mark Zuckerberg controversy. It was regarding the tech billionare's comment on allowing holocaust deniers to exist on Facebook. This lengthy piece not only explains the context of quote but also goes on to explain the multilateral connundrum of governing Facebook. It argues that, fundamentally, Mark thinks of Facebook as  a quasigovernmental organization. It makes a very compelling case. Certainly read it if you can spare 10 minutes.

## Small is Beautiful
Croatia had a great world cup. But what can we learn more about a country we hardly hear of. How does an average croation lead his life. Is his/her life mired with poverty? Turns out, No. In [this](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/across-the-aisle-france-wins-honours-croatia-wins-hearts-5269344/) piece the former finance minister of government of India, [P. Chidambaram](https://twitter.com/PChidambaram_IN?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), argues that small countries can proser and prosper well. This piece goes on to give policy suggestions which are applicable to larger countries the main idea being decentralization.

## Are we all goint to die - Yes
Sorry about the harsh title. But if [this](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/climate-change-and-the-giant-iceberg-off-greenlands-shore) New Yorker piece by [Carolyn Kormann](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/carolyn-kormann) is anything to go by the title can't be more apt. This piece gives us ample amount of spooky observations to explain the real effect climate change can have on our lives. We have probably not done anything close to enough to slow its effects. I can't put a positive spin on this.

## Refugees- aren't they also people?
Recently a bunch of interior ministers from EU countries gathered in Austria. They discussed how to "secure" EU's border. This "security" will not allow refugees to get into EU. This will also be coupled with a future EU border guard force and some sort of camps. When people say camps and Europe in the same sentence I am scared. This sort of clearly xenophobic policies should have no place in a liberal EU. But the fact is these are democractic countries and these ministers might very well represent the views of the majority. Refugees are people who have rights granted to them by the Geneva Convention of which these European Countries are signatories.
