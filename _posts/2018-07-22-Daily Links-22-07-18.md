## The Most Connected Government - Facebook

In [this](https://www.vox.com/explainers/2018/7/20/17590694/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-holocaust-denial-recode) piece [erza klien](https://www.vox.com/authors/ezra-klein) explains the recent Mark Zuckerberg controversy. It was regarding the tech billionare's comment on allowing holocaust deniers to exist on Facebook. This lengthy piece not only explains the context of quote but also goes on to explain the multilateral connundrum of governing Facebook. It argues that, fundamentally, Mark thinks of Facebook as  a quasigovernmental organization. It makes a very compelling case. Certainly read it if you can spare 10 minutes.
