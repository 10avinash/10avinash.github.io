I read through various news articles from different sources. I will post the article's links and a short take on the article. 

## Data Transfer
There seems to be a new development in the tech industry regarding data. But this time it is not a scandal. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter are partnering on a "Data Transfer Project" which can streamline the way in which you can view and obtain your own information held by these tech giants. This is perhaps an interesting tool, but its success will depend on ease of its usage and the awareness it creates. I believe that along with data, the tech companies should be obligated to provide a reason for each bit of data collected. Why are you collecting my location and where did you use it? Why are you collection my facial recognintion data and where exactly did you use it? Can you show me what is my social media profile as viewed by the business end of the company?
These questions need to be answered.

## America if you are listening

There seems to be a general belief that Trump's "performance" in Helsinki was disgraceful. Can anyone please explain to me why it is called performance? Anyway in [this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/russia-might-have-been-lost-from-the-start/2018/07/19/e45c1a42-8b92-11e8-8aea-86e88ae760d8_story.html?utm_campaign=b4934ff195-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_07_20_06_14&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Fareed%27s%20Global%20Briefing&utm_term=.861e71fc1c3d) piece for the Washington Post, [Fareed Zakaria](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/fareed-zakaria/?utm_term=.46407901aa92) argues that the reason Russia tries to undermine the west is the west. There is a trust gap between the west and Russia and it can be explained by the inability of west to be adaptive to Russian interests. This can be traced to the end of soviet union in early 1990s.

## The African French Team.
I watched the world cup with great enthusiasm. Eventhough the team I supported, Belgium, couldn't win, they weren't so bad. They after all defeated Belgium. But there is no doubt France was simply superb. The team boasted of great talent in the form of Paul Pogba, Antoine Griezmann, Kylian Mbappé, N'Golo Kanté, Hugo Lloris and Raphaël Varane, etc. They were too good to not win the World Cup. But the identity of the team has caused a stir around the world. Read [this](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-french-connection-on-and-off-the-pitch/article24476840.ece?homepage=true) piece by [Emile Chabal](http://www.homepages.ed.ac.uk/echabal/) to navigate the complexities of this question.
