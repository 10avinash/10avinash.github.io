I read through various news articles from different sources. I will post the article's links and a short take on the article. 

**Data Transfer**  
There seems to be a new development in the tech industry regarding data. But this time it is not a scandal. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter are partnering on a "Data Transfer Project" which can streamline the way in which you can view and obtain your own information held by these tech giants. This is perhaps an interesting tool, but its success will depend on ease of its usage and the awareness it creates. I believe that along with data, the tech companies should be obligated to provide a reason for each bit of data collected. Why are you collecting my location and where did you use it? Why are you collection my facial recognintion data and where exactly did you use it? Can you show me what is my social media profile as viewed by the business end of the company?
These questions need to be answered.
