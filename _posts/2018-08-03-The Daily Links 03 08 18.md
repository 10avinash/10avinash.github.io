## The National Register of Confusion (NRC)
Indian seems to be drafting up a National register of citizens (NRC) in Assam, a northeastern hilly state. This is being done in a supreme court monitored process due to the [signing of Assam Accord in 1985](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/the-citizenry-test-assam-nrc-explained/article24560028.ece). The accord signed by then central government and student's unions in backdrop of anti illegal migrant movement. This is targetted on [Bangladeshi immigrants](https://indianexpress.com/article/research/nrc-what-the-assam-accord-of-1985-said-about-immigrants-in-assam-5287009/) who came to India because of Pakistani military crackdown in what was then East-Pakistan. 
Recently a draft of NRC was released and 40 Lakh people( 4 Million people) have been left out. Many times a member of the family finds his/her name and other's don't. This is creating confusion and perhaps a sense of anxiety. Also, no one really understands what will happen to people who  have been left out of the list. Will they be deported? Will they be allowed to stay without voting rights? [No answers](https://theprint.in/governance/in-assam-nrc-is-now-national-register-of-confusion/92461/) have been provided by the central government.
