Hello World was probably the first program you learned in a computer programming class. But it is also an apt tile to the first official blogpost in 10avinash. Our world is filled with problems. They are primarily political, social, economic, technological and environmental. These problems are difficult to solve but not impossible. 

The solution begins by recognizing that many of us might have fundamentally different views on how to solve a problem. But what we shouldn't do is name calling. The only way forward for us is working together. If we want to work together, we should focus on building an understanding on a common set of facts and then having a logical thought process which brings about an amicable solution. 

I will try and hopefully post interesting things. I don't really know how this will fare out but I would  look to blend in economics, statistics, world politics and , ofcourse, programming. I am not a good programmer, but for saying "Hello World" the print command is enough.
