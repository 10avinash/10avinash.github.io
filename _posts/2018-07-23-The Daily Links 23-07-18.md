## Hell-**Sink**i
The summit between President Trump and President Putin in Helsinki was to say the least not great. But this New Yorker article, by one of my favorites David Remnick, is so incivesely sharp that it could cause bleeding. The post says and I quote "Trump proved himself, at best, a heedless amateur, blind to the bogus arguments and offers being made by a shrewd adversary". THis is a great article for anyone to understand the gravity of President Trump's actions. You can be a normal supporter of Trump, but  you have to remember that alienating your closest allies to be on one man's good graces is not really smart.
