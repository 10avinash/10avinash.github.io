## Hell-**Sink**i
The summit between President Trump and President Putin in Helsinki was to say the least not great. But [this](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-unwinding-of-donald-trump) New Yorker article, by one of my favorites [David Remnick](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/david-remnick), is so incivesely sharp that it could cause bleeding. The post says and I quote "Trump proved himself, at best, a heedless amateur, blind to the bogus arguments and offers being made by a shrewd adversary". This is a great article for anyone to understand the gravity of President Trump's actions. You can be a normal supporter of Trump, but  you have to remember that alienating your closest allies to be on one man's good graces is not really smart.
