## Get Out and Vote
Normally I try to add a, if you will, witty title to any post here. But [this](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/comment/get-out-and-vote) article in the New Yorker has a good headline and a greater meaning to it. It talks about how institutions in the United States seems to have not lived up to their constitutional functions especially after the election of its newest president. While Nixon had institutional checks and balances, P45 can function with a sort of an amnesty. These questions and the article even though might seem partisan it's not. It's about how institutions have corroded to explain the political system.


## Israel: Jewish State or Democracy
[This](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/israel-passes-a-law-stating-whats-jewish-about-a-jewish-and-democratic-state)  new yorker piece explains the origins of the establishment of a state in which minorities are increasingly alienated. It analyzes, how Israel, the most advanced countries in the region and an innovation power has come to become, now officially, a Jewish democracy. Read the piece as it will give you a context. To me Israel will always be defined by a single quote from former secretary of state John Kerry " Israel can be Jewish or democratic, not both."
